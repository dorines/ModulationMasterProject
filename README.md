# Master project Dorine Schenk, Modulation
Code used during master research project on the modulation experiment at Nikhef, Amsterdam.
To analyse measured radioactive decay rate, temperature and radon concentration data.
To do simulations to determine needed measurement time to retrieve daily and yearly modulations on top of an exponential decay.
